This is faster than the older USB 1.1 standard but much slower than the newer USB 3.0 standard. There are numerous protocols for Ethernet-style networking over USB. The main motivation for these protocols is to allow application-independent exchange of data with USB devices, instead of specialized protocols such as video or MTP. Even though USB is not a physical Ethernet, the networking stacks of all major operating systems are set up to transport IEEE 802.3 frames, without caring much what the underlying transport really is."

The fiber-based fast Ethernet standards 100 Base-FX, 100 Base SX, 100 Base BX and 100 Base LX10 use one or more strands and modes of fiber optics to transmit data.
